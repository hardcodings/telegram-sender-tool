# How It Works:
- Session Saving: The TelegramClient('session_name', api_id, api_hash) automatically saves the session into a file named session_name.session.
- When you run the script again, it won't ask you to log in if the session is still valid.
- Login: The script starts by logging in using your phone number. If the session is already saved, it skips this step.
- Sending Messages: It reads a file (users.txt) containing usernames or phone numbers and sends a message to each one.
